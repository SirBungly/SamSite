ZHELNA and DEKKA are perched, surveying the city from their vantage point. Both are wearing battle-tested HIGH-TECH ARMOUR with JETPACKS. Zhelna's bears the distinctive mark of a soldier of the MIDWIFE division, whilst Dekka's seems to be assembled from a selection of more worn items from various factions. The HUMDRUM of the city buzzes beneath them. The breeze catches a strand of Zhelna's BRAIDED HAIR and she tucks it back into place, frustrated.

ZHELNA
The invitation said they should have finished the symposium by now.

DEKKA
I mean we could've got the wrong exit.

ZHELNA
No, Cadmius definitely said it was gonna be here. And we've trusted him before. He's never been wrong.

Zhelna stands, raising her SNIPER RIFLE to her face. The light from the SCOPE illuminates her black eyes.

DEKKA
(Hushed)
Hey! Someone could see us.

ZHELNA
I've done this a million times before. If someone wanted to see us, they would already be right on top of us.

DEKKA
Sometimes your confidence... staggers me. You know if we get caught doing this we'll--

Zhelna looks at Dekka, lowering the scope.

ZHELNA
(Sternly)
You think I don't know the consequences of trying to infiltrate the upper city? That I somehow haven't factored them in?

DEKKA
You know what I mean. I'm just trying to...

Dekka tails off. A slight commotion in the CROWD below as four MASKED FIGURES exit from a RUSTY DOOR.

ZHELNA
We've got them. You ready?

Dekka nods. Before the pair can act, the figures have already split in four different directions, slipping their way through the crowd with urgency.

DEKKA
Shit.

ZHELNA
That one. I've got him. Back me up.

Zhelna points to the northernmost figure, who is weaving away from their location towards the CENTRAL THOROUGHFARE.

Activating her MASK, it slides into place and covers her head completely, the panels meshing together like a robotic jigsaw. The crimson LENSES that protrude from in front of her eyes pulsate.

She jumps, her jetpack activating with a sharp WOOSH. Zhelna twists her hand, revealing a set of three SURGICAL SCALPELS, each THRUMMING with a laser-like energy that wraps around their blades. Flicking her arm, the scalpels fly through the air. They hit the figure's calf with a CRACK, sending him tumbling to the ground.

Zhelna activates a CLOAKING DEVICE a few metres before deftly hitting the ground, disguising her entry into the crowd. She uncloacks, rushing towards a gap in the crowd that has now opened around the injured figure, his BLACK ROBES now stained with blood. He attempts to stand but cannot.

ZHELNA
(Pushing through the crowd, in an empathetic voice)
Is someone hurt? Coming through, excuse me.

Zhelna makes it into the parting created in the crowd.

ZHELNA (CONT'D)
Everything is okay, please stay clam. I'm a Midwife - I'm trained to handle medical emergencies. Are you ok? Let's treat you somewhere less exposed.

As she goes to lift the figure up, he tries to resist. She reacts, discretely pulling a HIDDEN BLADE from her sleeve, pushing it against the small of his back.

ZHELNA (CONT'D)
Coming through! Make way, please.

Dekka also lands, uncloaking a few metres from the commotion. He catches up with Zhelna who is carrying the masked figure towards the warehouse.

DEKKA
(Under his breath)
Everything go to plan?

ZHELNA
Well, I just egregiously broke my hypocratic oath, but apart from that - yeah, we're good. (pause) He's a bit of a wriggler, watch him.
